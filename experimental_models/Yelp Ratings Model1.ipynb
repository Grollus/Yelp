Comfy for a small space, but with enough room that you're not on top of other guests. \\n\\nHappy hour prices were very reasonable. 2 flatbreads and 2 beers for $16. The flatbreads we got (Margarita and BBQ Chicken) were delicious and good sized. \\n\\nService was quick and very friendly. He stopped the table when he was needed and left us alone when he wasn't. \\n\\nHighly recommend popping in for a drink and a bite to eat! I will definitely be back!\",\n",

We're not just talking miso soup or mochi ice cream either!  Delicious pork belly, yummy grilled veggies, daily sushi specials, green tea cake, black sesame creme brulee...these are some unique offerings.\\n\\nSushi here is good, and the daily specials always offer a good variety of fish to try.  All of my visits start out with me ordering one of every special, both sushi and grilled items.  The one thing that I haven't really been fond of is the rice.  I know that they get very busy, but it seems like their sushi rice is almost fresh from the rice cooker; by time the sushi gets to the table, the rice is warm and the fish feels like it's been sitting at room temperature for a while.  It's never been bad enough to ruin a meal, but it is something I notice each visit.  To be fair, other people I've dined with either don't notice it or it isn't a big deal, so it could be a personal thing.\\n\\nOutside of my little rice quirk, Goyemon is a solid choice for sushi.  It has a big roll selection for your casual sushi friends, as well as a good fish selection for you nigiri folk.  Add in the appetizers and desserts to help cleanse your palate, and you have a dinner spot fit for most, if not all of your friends!\",\n",
