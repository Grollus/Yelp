    "# Predicting Yelp Ratings from Review Text"
   ]
  },

    "In part two of my series of posts on the Yelp academic [dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) I'm diving head first into predicting Yelp ratings. As discussed in [part one](https://www.ahoulette.com/2018/04/11/reviewing-yelp/), this data set is rather large, so there's a lot of data I could potentially use in modeling. I could, like I'd imagine Yelp actually *does*, build a big ensemble model. I'd build some models using text data, some using tabular attribute data, etc, and then I could ensemble these models together in an attempt to build the most robust model possible. But the point of this post is *not* to build the most accurate model I can, it's to explore some NLP advances to see how well I can predict ratings with the review text alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "So keep in mind that this model could easily be improved(in many, many ways), but the goal is just to get a handle on implementing some cutting edge NLP concepts and build a reasonably accurate model. This model will eventually make it's way into a proof-of-concept website, which will be the topic of part three of this series of posts."

    "First things first, I need to bring in my data. Back during my initial exploration I randomly sampled the review data set for 350,000 reviews. This is about 15% of the total number of restaurant reviews, but it should be plenty to building reasonably accurate models that don't take hours to train. Note: during the tuning of these models, I've actually taken even smaller samples of this data so I can quickly iterate and train models in a matter of seconds."

One of the numerous things I've learned while taking [fastai's](http://course.fast.ai/) MOOC's is that a Naive Bayes linear classifier is a really solid baseline for NLP problems. Let's take a look and see how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes uses Bayes theorem to calculate the conditional probability of a rating given some text. Of course, this is quite vague. Say my review is \"This restaurant is terrible\". I could take that 4 word sentence and see how often it appears in 1 star reviews and then see how often it appears in 5 star reviews. With those counts you could calculate a probability ratio telling you what type of review that text appears in more frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I'm sure you've noticed a problem. How many reviews have that *exact* text 'This restaurant is terrible'? We'd never get satisfying results because reviews would all have unique text. A simple way around this is to remove all the structure of the sentences and just use a bag of words representation of review text. \"This restaurant is terrible\" becomes a vector with counts of \"This\", \"restaurant\", \"is\", \"terrible\". For this baseline model I am just using unigrams, but bi/trigrams could easily be used as well (and could results in a modest accuracy bump). \n",
    "\n",
    "As one final preprocessing step, I'm actually going to use tfidf(term frequency, inverse-document frequency) rather than simple word counts to represent the word vectors. Essentially, this weights the words to show how important a word is to a particular review--so frequently used words, such as 'the', have a lower weight since they appear so often in almost every review.\n",

    "With the text in a usable form, I can now apply Bayes theorem. We want to answer the questions: given the review \"This restaurant is terrible\", what is the probability this is a 1 star review and what is the probability this is a 5 star review(this all works the same for 1-5 star reviews, it's just easier to illustrate with a binary classification). Well, another way of asking this question is: what is the probability of a one star review given the words \"This\", \"restaurant\", \"is\", \"terrible\"? If we assume each word is independent of the other (a very naive assumption--but where naive bayes gets it's name), then we can calculate this by:\n",
    "$$\\textit{P(this|1 star)} \\times \\textit{P(restaurant|1 star)} \\times \\textit{P(is|1 star)} \\times \\textit{P(terrible|1 star)}$$\n",

This would cause a lot of issues, so we get around it by adding 1 to all word counts. This basically says--yeah, we haven't seen that word yet, but we acknowledge it's possible it might occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all this, you can calculate the probability of a 'This restaurant is terrible' given a 1 star review and given a 5 star review. Once calculated, we just predicted the rating of whichever probability is highest--or we can divide them and predict 1 star if positive and 5 stars if negative. \n",

These middling reviews could be considered more ambiguous.  This is a problem that is particular to this sort of data set and is one all our models will have to deal with. 1 and 5 star reviews tend to be very positive or very negative (think back to my initial analysis [here](https://www.ahoulette.com/2018/04/11/reviewing-yelp/) to see more details). This makes them relatively easy to classify. But what happens when you have a *pretty* good review? The characteristics of 3 and 4 star reviews are much more similar than those of 1 and 5 star reviews, so classifying them correctly is *going* to be more difficult. If you just look at a couple reviews you can see how difficult this can be for humans, let alone machines."

    "The first big development in NLP that I want to look at are embeddings or word vectors. The basic Word2Vec technique attempts to represent a words meaning by counting the context in which a word appears. Since we are dealing with natural language, this would be many thousands of different contexts, resulting in vectors with potentially millions of dimensions. As an example, you could see 'it' appear contextually as 'it was', 'it wasn't', 'it became', and 'it sat' just to name a few. Since it *doesn't* appear in thousands of other contexts, what we'd end up getting is a long vector  of \\[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, ...] where there is a 0 in contexts where that word wasn't seen and a count with the number of times that word appeared in the other spots. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that you can represent most of this information (or vector space) with far fewer dimensions so word vectors use dimensionality reduction techniques to reduces the number of dimensions down to, say, 25-300. For a more detailed overview of the basic idea, this [gist](https://gist.github.com/aparrish/2f562e3737544cf29aaf1af30362f469) is a good code focused walk through.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might not, initially, seem all that useful, but what these word vectors do is tell us the relationship between words. Since they are vectors, we can perform arithmetic with them. The canonical example goes something like this: what do you get if you take ***queen*** and subtract ***woman***? A ***king***. Or what about if you add ***frozen*** to ***water***? You get ***ice***!  There is something really cool about this to me and I'd encourage you to explore the concept yourself to learn more.\n",

    "The bad news is that training your own word vectors requires an enormous amount of text data. Luckily, there are several very good precomputed vectors(or embeddings) which are freely distributed and available for modeling. Here I'll be using [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) embeddings taken from the twitter corpus. There are GloVe embeddings from other sources, such as Wikipedia or the common crawl, as well as other embeddings like FastText. Since I know from exploration that reviews often contain non-standard english and unusual punctuation/language I thought twitter seemed fitting. It performed the best out of the embeddings I tried, but depending on your data set another embedding may perform better. If you want to get really fancy you can combine embeddings--that seems to be very common and very powerful if Kaggle competitions are any indication.\n",

One area where I could definitely squeeze out some more accuracy is by fixing all the contractions that are missing from the embedding vocabulary.

    "One thing I found after doing a *ton* of research and looking at many, many, many Kaggle competitions is that the specs of the neural network itself are often less important than other components of the model pipeline. In this case, I tried combinations of LSTM(long short-term memory) layers, GRU(gated recurrent units) layers, adding multiple dense layers, stacking multiple GRU or LSTM layers, bidirectional vs standard layers, etc and all had pretty similar levels of performance. I ended up going with an architecture that was successfully applied in the Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/discussion/52644). I used that structure as my baseline and nothing I tried beat it by much. I did have a double GRU followed by a huge dense layer structure that performed marginally better, but took quite a bit longer to train so I abandoned it.\n",

    "Just a couple implementation notes: I set trainable to true even though I am using pretrained embeddings. This resulted in a higher accuracy. This is probably related to fine tuning the vectors and training vectors for the numerous words that didn't appear in the glove twitter embeddings. I also set up earlystop and checkpoint callbacks. Early stop will automatically stop training the model after your desired metric is no longer improving. This was really handy because I could just set the number of epochs to a relatively high number and let keras automatically stop when overfitting is likely occurring. Thanks to checkpoint, the weights from the best epoch are saved."

I think is probably the single largest area for improvement.\n",

The basic idea is to use machine translation to translate the reviews to, say, French and then back to English. This will alter the text of the review effectively giving you more data. This should be useful in reducing overfitting and allowing you to train a better model. Additionally, the machine translation will often take care of simple text correction which is helpful for accuracy. This technique was applied very successfully in some recent Kaggle classification competitions.\n",

At the end of the day though, what you really care about in practice is 'what business problem is this model helping to solve?'. While in a professional data science environment the identification of the business problem comes first, since this is a toy project, the pipeline is a little off kilter. But that doesn't mean I can't do a little thought experiment and examine how this model could be useful in practice. \n",

    "* An obvious application of this model would be to help eliminate mislabeled reviews(example below). While exploring the data, it was obvious that some reviews labeled 1 star were actually positive reviews and vice versa for 5 star reviews.  People certainly misclick reviews and this is bad. If people go to a restaurant labeled 5 stars on Yelp and have a 1 star experience, then the trust they put into future reviews goes down. Maybe that means they don't go to Yelp for reviews as often. That's bad for business. But with this model, you could read the text of the review and say 'Oh, this seems like a 4 star review. You labeled it 1 star. Is that correct?' Alleviating mislabeled reviews could be quite helpful for Yelp."

    "* Another potential use would be identifying really negative reviews before they are posted and adding some sort of 'intervention check'. What do I mean by this? Well, really awful Yelp reviews can be extremely damaging to a restaurant--especially if it is new. And often when someone has a bad experience at a restaurant, they want to vent and completely nitpick and destroy that restaurant to feel better. Bad reviews are an important component of the site, but what if when a really bad/toxic review was detected (one with a very high probability score for 1 star), you saw an additional page before confirming your post. Who knows what the wording would be, but something just reminding you that that restaurant is owned by *people* and to take a breath before posting a damning review.  This would have to be highly tested, but it could be a component of making reviews less of a potentially toxic environment.\n",

    "Perhaps a better business focused model would be one just identifying the positive/negative reviews or one identifying 'toxic' reviews whether good or bad. Identifying toxic reviews would require a labeled data set for toxic comments though, and identifying positive/negative reviews was something I looked at initially, but I wanted more of a challenge :) "
